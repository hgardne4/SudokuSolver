Henry Gardner
Sudoku Puzzle Solver

My roommate and I started playing a lot of sudoku and would always try and get the fastest time on Expert mode on sudoku.com. My best time got to under 3 minutes with no notes and I decided to write code to do it for me. Pleasently suprised to see that this solved an "expert" level in under .03 seconds. Looks like I have to practice more.
